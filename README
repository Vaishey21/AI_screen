# Candidate Ranking System

This project is a web-based application that ranks candidates based on their interview responses using a machine learning model. The system processes responses and predicts scores for each candidate, allowing them to be ranked accordingly.

## Technologies Used

- **Flask**: For building the web application.
- **Pandas**: For data handling and processing.
- **Scikit-learn**: For the machine learning pipeline and model.
- **Pickle**: For saving and loading the trained model.
- **NLTK**: For text preprocessing (tokenization and stopword removal).

## How it Works

1. **Home Page**:

   - Users can input candidate responses through a web interface.

2. **Ranking Candidates**:
   - Responses are sent to the `/rank` endpoint via a POST request.
   - The system preprocesses the responses, predicts scores using the trained model, and returns a ranked list of candidates.
